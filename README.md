# Assignment-1
	
For this assignment I used the 2D Game Kit from the Unity store to further familiarize myself with the Unity platform. I used the Tile Palette to create a level, then used the 2D game kit assets to add: enemies, switch-activated door, moving platform, pushable box that damages enemies, transition point to next scene, various decorations.
